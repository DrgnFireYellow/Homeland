_A plugin that adds a plot system similar to that of Hypixel Housing._

This plugin allows players on your server to access their own small superflat world by running the `/house` command. In this superflat world, some blocks will have unique properties. Other players can then visit this superflat world using the `/visit` command.

## Usage
After installing the plugin, players can go to their house world by running the `/house` command.
Players can visit other player's house worlds in adventure mode by using the `/visit` command followed by the player who owns the house that they want to visit. Players can change settings for their house world by using the `/housesetting` command followed by the name of the setting and the value to set it too.

## House Settings
- `time`: Allows the player to change the time of day in their house world. Accepted values are `sunrise`, `day`, `noon`, `night`, `midnight`, or any integer.

## Unique Block Behaviors
Some blocks will behave differently when placed in a house world.

### Affected Blocks
- Slime Block: Will bounce the player significantly higher.
